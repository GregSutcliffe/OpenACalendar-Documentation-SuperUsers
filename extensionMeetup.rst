Extension Meetup
================

Purpose
-------

Importing by URL

Go to the :doc:`sysadmin Web UI <systemAdministratorWebUI>`.

Go to the url /sysadmin/meetupuser

You must enter an Meetup App Key. Obtain one from the Meetup API site. https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/

You should now see that app key has been filled in.

The extension has been set up.

Useage
